Summary of the OpenSergo community biweekly meeting (Sep 28th, 2022)

1. We showed how a framework could leverage OpenSergo SDK to integrate with OpenSergo, and manage the service goverance rules via OpenSergo Control Plane.
2. Logging is an essential part of microservices. We've discussed ideas of log governance with iLogtail community.
